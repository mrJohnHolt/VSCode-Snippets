# DaVinci-Resolve

Davinci Resolve Development

This is the GitHub repository for the new 2022 Resolve Development.

I'm John a Freelance DaVinci Resolve & Fusion Asset Creator, whether it is Titles, Transitions, Templates, Video Collages and Assets for your production.

Do you create templates for DaVinci Resolve? I am available to customize the inspector to make it more efficient.

I can also modify the code behind templates to add labels, drop down menus, custom controls and pre-sets.
